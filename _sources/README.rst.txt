Steps to use
============

2) Create a YAML file with required entries for Products, Versions or Files (See :doc:`entrypoints_reference` for more details)
3) Use *push-cgw-metadata* entrypoint to do the push operation


Example
--------------

Example YAML file
....................
In this example we are creating one product.
We have created this `cgw_example.yaml` file with the following content

.. code-block::

    - type: product                                             # MANDATORY
      state: create                                             # MANDATORY
      metadata:
        name: "Test Product"                                    # MANDATORY
        productCode: "TestProduct"                              # MANDATORY
        homepage: "https://test.com/"                           # OPTIONAL
        downloadpage: "https://test.com/"                       # OPTIONAL
        thankYouPage: "https://test.com/"                       # OPTIONAL
        eloquaCode: "NOT_SET"                                   # OPTIONAL
        featuredArtifactType: "Server"                          # OPTIONAL
        thankYouTimeout: 5


Use of entrypoint
....................
``push-cgw-metadata`` (:doc:`entrypoints_reference`) entrypoint needs to be invoked to do the pushes.
The below is an example of its invocation

.. code-block::

  push-cgw-metadata -host https://content-gateway/example.com \
                    -p XXXXX \
                    -u username \
                    -f full_path_to_yaml_file/cgw_example.yaml

  2022-09-21 12:29:01,508 [INFO    ] Data validation successful for product: TestProduct
  2022-09-21 12:29:01,508 [DEBUG   ] Fetching for product_id of product_name:- Test Product and product_code:- TestProduct

  2022-09-21 12:29:01,515 [DEBUG   ] Starting new HTTPS connection (1): content-gateway/example.com:443

  2022-09-21 12:29:03,808 [INFO    ] Created a new product with product_id:- 4009801

  2022-09-21 12:29:03,808 [DEBUG   ] Updating the invisible attribute of the created records
  2022-09-21 12:29:03,808 [DEBUG   ] Enabling the created records if required

  2022-09-21 12:29:03,808 [INFO    ]
  All CGW operations are successfully completed...!

We can see in the logs that the product is created with some ID.
